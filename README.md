# What I learned
* Basic front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Basic back-end development (PHP, mySQL)
* Basic video uploading system with PHP and MySQL   

# Issue that still need to be addressed
* find alternative of ffmpeg since free hosting doesnt support it. or maybe just buy a server.
* generate 3 thumbnails after user selected a video. user then can choose one of them.
